**Title:** Adding a comment is difficult on touch screens due to lack of send
button

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Open the web application in a new session with touch screen
2. Log in as a user
3. Publish a new post on your wall
4. Type a comment in the input field of the post
5. Press the "Enter" key to add the comment

**Expected results:**

There should be a visible button (e.g. "Add" or some icon) that users can press
to add a comment especially on touch screen devices.

**Actual behavior:**

On touch screen devices, there is no dedicated add button for adding the
comment. Users must press "Enter" on the keyboard which can be confusing or
unconventional for users on mobile devices with small screens or virtual
keyboards.
