**Title:** The delete button is difficult to click on posts when browser window
width is below 770px

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Open the web application in a new browser session
2. Log in as a user
3. Click your profile name to get to your profile page on right top corner
4. Publish a new post on your wall
5. Reduce the browser window width below 770 pixels

**Expected results:**

The delete button is fully visible and easily clickable without any interference
or distractions.

**Actual behavior:**

When the browser window width is reduced below 770 pixels:

- A vertical scroll bar appears over the delete button
- In Firefox, the button is very difficult to click due to the scroll bar
- In Google Chrome, the appearance is confusing making it unclear how to
  interact with the button
